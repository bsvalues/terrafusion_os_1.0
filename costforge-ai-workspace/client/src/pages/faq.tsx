          answer: "TerraBuild (formerly BCBS) is the official property assessment platform used by county assessors, property managers, and construction professionals to accurately estimate building costs across Benton County, Washington.

          question: "Who can access and use the BCBS?",
          answer: "The BCBS is an open-access system available to all county officials, property developers, construction managers, and general public in Benton County. No authentication is required to use the basic features of the system."

          question: "How accurate are the cost estimates?",
          answer: "The cost estimates provided by BCBS have a documented accuracy rate of 97% when compared to actual construction costs. The system is regularly updated with the latest cost data to ensure estimates remain accurate and relevant."
        },
        {
          question: "How often is the cost data updated?",
          answer: "The cost matrix data is updated annually with the latest construction costs. Special updates may be made mid-year if there are significant changes in material or labor costs that would affect accuracy."
