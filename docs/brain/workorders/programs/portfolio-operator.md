# Portfolio Operator Program

**Goal:** `GOAL-PORTFOLIO-OPERATOR-001`

**Loop:** `LOOP-PORTFOLIO-OPERATOR-001`

**Status:** Active at `WO-ATLAS-008` - GIS package Mapbox token metadata disposition audit

## Purpose

Select and activate the highest-priority dependency-cleared program whenever an active program
closes. The owner is an authority wall, not the dispatcher between completed programs.

## Selection Algorithm

1. Fetch and reconcile current `origin/main`.
2. Read the program register, active playbook, command map, program queue, wall ledger, and
   cross-program dependency graph.
3. Exclude completed, superseded, dependency-blocked, parked, and authority-gated next nodes.
4. Rank executable nodes by risk, continuity, dependency readiness, and register order.
5. Activate the highest-ranked program goal and loop.
6. Start its first dependency-cleared Work Order and continue until a true wall or program closeout.
7. On closeout, repeat portfolio reconciliation instead of returning a next-program selection stop.

## Standing Delivery Authority

`OWNER-TF-STANDING-OPERATOR-AUTHORITY` continuously authorizes routine delivery mechanics for every
already-ratified program and dependency-cleared Work Order inside its separate scope. The operator
owns worktrees, implementation judgment, validation, commits, pushes, PRs, exact-head assurance,
review remediation, eligible squash merges, post-merge verification, closeout, and continuation.

The grant does not make any parked node executable. A new program, protected boundary, destructive
action, or other true wall still requires its own authority.

## Valid Portfolio Stops

- canonical backlog genuinely empty;
- every remaining node dependency-blocked;
- every remaining node requires production, county, PACS, secret, deployment, schema, or protected
  resource authority;
- two top candidates create a real strategic conflict; or
- canon cannot establish a valid next lane.

`NEXT_PROGRAM_SELECTION_REQUIRED` is not a valid stop when an executable canonical node exists.

## Current Reconciliation

> **Snapshot, not live routing (CONTINUATION_RULEBOOK §7).** This section records the selection at a point
> in time. The authoritative live "current node / next WO" is
> [WORK_ORDER_PROGRAM_QUEUE.md](../WORK_ORDER_PROGRAM_QUEUE.md); if this snapshot disagrees, the queue wins.

At `origin/main` `c2744855cc6ae4f8966f6ed8460b065588e8908b`, WO-ATLAS-008 proves the GIS
package's live browser source and types use `VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`. The README and integration
metadata retain an unconsumed `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` name and are classified as stale without package
mutation or token access.

`WO-ATLAS-009 - GIS Package Mapbox Token Metadata Alignment` is next as bounded R3 work.

STOP_TYPE: `GIS_TOKEN_METADATA_DISPOSITION_COMPLETE_ALIGNMENT_NEXT`
